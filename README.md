## CI/CD Workflow
### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Triggers when changes are pushed to `cribl-pipelines/`.
- Uses the Cribl API to deploy updated pipelines.
- Requires a secret `CRIBL_TOKEN` for authentication.

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Checkout Repository** - Pulls the latest code.
2. **Install Dependencies** - Ensures `jq` is available for JSON parsing.
3. **Deploy Pipelines** - Uploads Cribl pipelines using the API.
4. **Verify Deployment** - Fetches and validates deployed pipelines.
