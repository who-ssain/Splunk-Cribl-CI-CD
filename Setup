## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/splunk-cribl-ci-cd.git
cd splunk-cribl-ci-cd
```

### 2. Configure Secrets
- In GitHub, navigate to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
- Add a new secret `CRIBL_TOKEN` with your API token.

### 3. Deploy Cribl Pipelines
- Push changes to `cribl-pipelines/` to trigger the workflow.
- Alternatively, run manually from the **Actions** tab.

### 4. Verify Deployment
